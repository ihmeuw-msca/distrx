   In this page, please use one or two paragraphs to summarize the main purpose of the package.
   Following the summary, please provide guidence of how people should use this documentation.

Statistics like variance and SE (standard error) are a measure of spread in data.
When shifting all of your data up or down (i.e. adding and subtracting a constant from your data),
you need not worry about tinkering with the variance or SE calculations.
However, when applying a nonlinear transformation to data (e.g. a log transform),
oneâ€™s intuition may be to simply apply the same function to the resulting statistics.
While this might work for things like the sample mean,
but doing this for SE will produce completely incorrect uncertainty estimates.
The distrx package aims to provide functions based in sound statistical theory
to allow users to apply common transformation functions in the health sciences field
to produce transformations and maintain correct uncertainty estimates.
