Percentage Change
=============

Currently percentage change is implemented in two ways. You can either provide raw data in the form
of observations from 2 separate, equally sized samples (as you would have from an experiment) or
raw counts with the separate, not necessarily equal sample sizes (as you would have from incidence
counts at two separate times)
